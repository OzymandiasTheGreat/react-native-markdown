# react-native-markdown monorepo

`@ozymandiasthegreat/react-native-markdown` is a pure javascript
library to render markdown to native/semantic
components. Runs everywhere expo and
react-native run.

I'm using a monorepo to make keeping track of
test/example apps easier.

You can find the main library in `packages/markdown`. There's readme with more information
and screenshots.

Test apps and examples are in the `apps` folder.
